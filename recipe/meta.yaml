  description: |
    Lead optimization mapper (LOMAP) is an automated algorithm to plan efficient 
    relative free energy calculations between potential ligands within a 
    substantial of compounds. The original LOMAP code was mainly based 
    on commercial APIs such as OpenEye and Schrodinger. 
    The aim of this project is to develop a new version of LOMAP based on 
    free avalaible APIs such as RDKit offering the scientific community 
    a free tool to plan in advance binding free energy calculations.
